# Product Factory

This is an example of a simple use case developed in rust with ink for polkadot 

The use case is to create, delegate and accept product delegations

To be able to use it simply clone the repository and install [rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) and [!ink](https://github.com/paritytech/ink#usage), then run the tests with: 

```cargo test```
